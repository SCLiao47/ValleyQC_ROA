### Quadratic Constraints for Local Stability Analysis of Quadratic Systems
by _Shih-Chi Liao, Maziar S. Hemati, Peter Seiler_

#### Abstract
This paper proposes new quadratic constraints (QCs) to bound a quadratic polynomial. Such QCs can be used in dissipation ineqaulities to analyze the stability and performance of nonlinear systems with quadratic vector fields. The proposed QCs utilize the sign-indefiniteness of certain classes of quadratic polynomials. These new QCs provide a tight bound on the quadratic terms along specific directions. This reduces the conservatism of the QC bounds as compared to the QCs in previous work. Two numerical examples of local stability analysis are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed QCs.
